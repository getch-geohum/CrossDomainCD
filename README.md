This work is the implementation of a conference paper [Deep Learning for Cross-Domain Building Change Detection from Multi-Source Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery](https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS53475.2024.10641261). Except for domain adaptation and some data loader sections, this repository is forked from the [codebase](https://github.com/wgcban/SemiCD) used for the implementation of [Bandara and Patel (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08454). On top of their work, we introduced an optimal transport [Courty et al.(2016)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2615921) domain adaptation approach for cross-domain change detection workflow. To implement domain adaptation we used an implementation from a dedicated package [POT: Python Optimal TransportÔÉÅ](https://pythonot.github.io/).
